# Machine Learning Notes & Projects

This repository contains my personal notes and projects while working through the book:

[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and PyTorch](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9798341607972/)

---

My application projects from the content in the textbook are rendered as .html files.

This is a work in progress and will be updated over the next few months.
